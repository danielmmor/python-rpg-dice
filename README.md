This is a Telegram bot which allows being added inside rpg or other groups. 
When given a dice command, e.g. /1d20, it gathers a true random number from https://www.random.org/ within the specificated range and returns it to the chat box inside Telegram.
If it receives more than one dice on command, e.g. /2d6, it gathers as many true random numbers as necessary and gives the sum after the individual values.
